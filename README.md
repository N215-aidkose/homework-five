#homework-four

This is the link to our homework assignment, Travel Fly, but this time it is responsive!

You must create a project named homework-four.
Your home page must look like the prototype
Your page must be responsive.
You can align the elements as you wish but they must look good and not touch the sides of the browser.
Upload your project to Github and Web4 and add your Web4 link to the README file.
